                </h1>
           <div > Cookies are small pieces of text which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website. Cookies are useful because they allow Spotify and our partners to uniquely recognise your device and support the continuity of your experience, for example by helping us to understand your preferences or past actions. You can find more general information about cookies at: www.allaboutcookies.org.
            Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. They help that website remember information about your visit, which can both make it easier to visit the site again and make the site more useful to you. Similar technologies, including unique identifiers used to identify an app or device, pixel tags, and local storage, can perform the same function. Cookies and similar technologies as described throughout this page can be used for the purposes described below.

            See the Privacy Policy to learn how we protect your privacy in our use of cookies and other information. </div>  </p>

                    2.How do we use Cookies
                </h1>
                <div>Cookies and similar technologies used for functionality allow you to access features that are fundamental to a service. Things considered fundamental to a service include remembering choices and preferences, like your choice of language; storing information relating to your session, such as the content of a shopping cart; enabling features or performing tasks requested by you; and product optimizations that help maintain and improve that service.

                    Some cookies and similar technologies are used to maintain your preferences. For example, most people who use Google services have a cookie called ‘NID’ or ‘_Secure-ENID’ in their browsers, depending on their cookies choices. These cookies are used to remember your preferences and other information, such as your preferred language, how many results you prefer to have shown on a search results page (for example, 10 or 20), and whether you want to have Google’s SafeSearch filter turned on. Each ‘NID’ cookie expires 6 months from a user’s last use, while the ‘_Secure-ENID’ cookie lasts for 13 months. Cookies called ‘VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE’ and ‘__Secure-YEC’ serve a similar purpose for YouTube and are also used to detect and resolve problems with the service. These cookies last for 6 months and for 13 months, respectively.</div>

                Google uses cookies for advertising, including serving and rendering ads, personalizing ads (depending on your settings at myadcenter.google.com, and adssettings.google.com/partnerads), limiting the number of times an ad is shown to a user, muting ads you have chosen to stop seeing, and measuring the effectiveness of ads.

The ‘NID’ cookie is used to show Google ads in Google services for signed-out users, while the ‘ANID’, ‘IDE’ and ‘id’ cookies are used to show Google ads on non-Google sites. Mobile advertising IDs, such as the Android’s Advertising ID (AdID), are used for a similar purpose on mobile apps, depending on your device settings. If you have personalized ads enabled, the ‘ANID’ and ‘IDE’ cookies are used to personalize the ads you see. If you have turned off personalized ads, the ‘ANID’ and ‘id’ cookies are used to remember this preference so you don’t see personalized ads. The ‘NID’ cookie expires 6 months after a user’s last use. The ‘ANID,’ ‘IDE,’ and ‘id’ cookies last for 13 months in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (UK), and 24 months everywhere else.
